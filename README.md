## React TypeScript App

Small React-TypeScript app with a Firebase login.

### How to run

After cloning the repo, run **"npm install"** inside the folder, and, after installation, run **"npm start"**

### How to use

Sign in in the app via Google or the test firebase email account:

**Email:** testuser@test.com
**Password:** 123456

Once inside the app, Redux catches the user information and some test data that will appear on both the Dashboard and Settings page.

Sign out by clicking the "Sign Out" icon situated in the top right corner of the page.
